    "# Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is a data structure with the <font color=green>**\"first in, last out\"** </font>property. <br>\n",
    "That is, an item can be inserted and removed from a stack, but an item can only be removed from the stack after all the items added after it are removed first.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> It supports three operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Insert (or \"Push\"): Putting an item into the stack.\n",
    "2. Peek: Look at the top item of the stack (the last inserted item that's not removed).\n",
    "3. Remove (or \"Pop\"): Remove the top item of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real world scenario, there are some situations we need to be careful of when doing an operation on a stack.<br>\n",
    "### Underflow\n",
    "Removing an item from a stack with no items will cause an \"underflow\" error. <br>\n",
    "Underflow errors can be prevented by <font color=green>**simply checking if the stack is empty**</font> before removing an item from the stack, as programs almost never want to pop from an empty stack.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overflow\n",
    "If we have a static sized array as a stack and we try to insert an item into the stack while it's full, it will cause an \"overflow\".<br>\n",
    "Overflow errors are a bit tricky, as programs sometimes would like to add more items to the stack.<br>\n",
    "<font color=green>**Use Dynamically sized array**.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time complexity\n",
    "Fortunately for modern programming languages, there is usually a dynamically sized array data structure, and they can be used as a stack.<br>\n",
    "Insertion and deletion from the list has a time complexity of * <font color=green>**O(1) (on average)** *</font><br>\n",
    "Because memories are dynamically assigned to the list, we don't have to worry about overflowing, because if it reaches a max size, the system will just allocate more memory for them.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "In Python, you can <font color=green>use the default list as a stack</font>, since all python lists are dynamically sized. \n",
